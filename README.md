# Quest Scan And Export Setup  

Every single time, I ask myself why I still haven't built a tool to export the Quest 3 mesh. 
But there‚Äôs more to consider:  
- Triangulation Points  
- Depth API Scan  
- Camera Images  
- Room Save Data  
- Guardian Fingerprint  
- ‚Ä¶and more  

This page will serve as a hub for all the tools I need to develop.  
Hope this helps! If you use this tool, feel free to send me a beer‚Äîbecause coding and maintaining all of this is going to be a serious effort. üçª
